# Big_Data_Systems
For the Big Data Systems part of this project you are required to:

    Take the data contained in the FinalProjectData.csv and store it in an appropriate database. You are a small start-up data analytics company and envisage rolling this solution out to all colleges in the world. Hence the database you choose must be able to deal with data from different modules/colleges, which may have different numbers of CA elements but still the same overall structure of CA & Final exam. It is also very important that your solution is able to scale to deal with billions of records and that it is backed up.
    Detail how the database you selected in part 1 will allow for the addition of potentially different structured data from different modules/colleges.
    Detail how your database will scale when your solution takes off and every college in the world wants to use your application to store and analyse all of their grade data.
    Detail how you will back up the data contained in the database and provide high availability to servers that need to query the data.
    You will be required to give an in-class demo of your database during class time 9:00-13:00 on Wednesday December 13th. This will be a joint presentation for Big Data Systems and Data Analysis 2. Please submit a database dump, word document with the answers to parts 2, 3 and 4 and a screencast detailing your work on Moodle by 23:55 Friday December 15th. This CA is worth 35% of the Big Data Systems Module.

For the Data Analysis 2 part of this project you are required to:

    Carry out an initial analysis of the data set. This should include, the identification and treatment of any outliers/missing data, the creation of appropriate visualisations and the generation of covariance & correlation statistics.
    Conduct a simple linear regression analysis: Determine the “best” simple linear regression model to predict end-of-module Exam grades. Explain your model & justify your choice of model.
    Conduct a multiple linear regression analysis: Fit a multiple regression line predicting end-of-module Exam grades. Justify your choice of features, interpret your model output and using, R2 and p-values, determine the usefulness of your model and the significance of each of the factors included.
    Carry out a k-means cluster analysis on the data. Justify your choice of k and detail how this choice was made.
    Investigate and describe the clusters which resulted from part 4. Do your findings from this cluster analysis support the hypothesis that having a part time job has a negative impact on student performance?
    Use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality in your data set, identify the first & second principal components of your data set and create appropriate visualisations of your clusters.
